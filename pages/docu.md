    [[pdf]](manual.pdf)
    
-   Usage information for the [JFlex maven
    plugin](http://jflex.sourceforge.net/jflex-maven-plugin/).
    
-   Usage information for the [JFlex Ant Task](jflex_anttask.html) (by
    Rafal Mantiuk).
    
-   A list of [external JFlex
    grammars](https://github.com/jflex-de/jflex/wiki/External-JFlex-Grammars)
    that other projects have created.
    
-   Syntax highlighting for JFlex in [Vim](vim.html) and
    [XEmacs](emacs.html).
    
-   [Japanese translation](jflex_manual_j.html) of an older version
    (1.1.2) of the JFlex manual (in Japanese Shift\_JIS encoding). Most
    of this still applies to the current version. See the [change
    log](history.html) for a list of changes. Many thanks to Yuichi
    Nakajima, Yukio Ikeda, Katsuhiko Yamazaki, and Koji Ooya for their
    efforts.
    If you would like to translate the JFlex manual into another
    language, or if you already have done so, please [let me
    know](mailto:lsf@jflex.de). I will include a link to it on this
    page. I can also give you access to the latex sources of the manual,
    so that printable versions of your translation can be generated,
    too.
    
-   The JFlex FAQ: [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.html)
    
-   There is a short series of articles on JFlex and Cup in the [Linux
    Gazette](http://www.linuxgazette.net/) by Richard A. Sevenich and
    Christopher Lopes. They give a very good introduction to parsing for
    people who are not familiar with the tools involved.
